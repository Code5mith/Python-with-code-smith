## Project #1 
### https://github.com/Code5mith/Python-with-code-smith/blob/main/weather_api_jupyter.ipynb

This project uses a simple weather_api data to analyse and visualize the weather condition in different parts of the world.

I havent gone through every possible functions of the data rather it is a very basic representation of how we can interact with apis with python and also 
how  we can filter and visualize the data we fetch from the api.

feel free to pull this repo and add more functionalities to it thank you.
